<!--11.26: form for unfollowing a user
#11.35: SINCE I'M NOT ON RAILS 3 THIS DOESN'T WORK WELL, IT DOESN'T REFRESH THE PG CORRECTLY:
 adding remote: true for async AJAX call which sends requests
to the server allowing you to stay on pg w/o having to redirect to the follow/unfollow code &
come back to the profile pg.
"remote: true" is Rails' way of adding the AJAX call-->
<%= form_for(current_user.relationships.find_by_followed_id(@user),
             html: { method: :delete }) do |f| %>
    <%= f.submit "Unfollow", class: "btn btn-large" %>
<% end %>
