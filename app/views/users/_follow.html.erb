<!--11.25: form for following a user
#11.35: SINCE I'M NOT ON RAILS 3 THIS DOESN'T WORK WELL, IT DOESN'T REFRESH THE PG CORRECTLY:
adding remote: true for async AJAX call which sends requests
to the server allowing you to stay on pg w/o having to redirect to the follow/unfollow code &
come back to the profile pg.
"remote: true" is Rails' way of adding the AJAX call-->
<%= form_for(current_user.relationships.build(followed_id: @user.id)) do |f| %>
    <div><%= f.hidden_field :followed_id %></div>
    <%= f.submit "Follow", class: "btn btn-large btn-primary" %>
<% end %>
